/* Question :- Given two strings s1="sghsdgfABBAdfkjgdhgdk" and s2="ABBA" . Write a program to check if s2 is present in s1 */
/* STRING MATCHING */

public class Check{
    public boolean patternCheck(String s1,String s2){
        int M=s1.length();
        int N=s2.length();
        int b=false;
        for(int i=0;i<(M-N);i++){//keeps track on string s1.....but upto (M-N) becoz we cant check after M.....it will give exception
            int j;
            for(j=0;j<N;j++){//keeps trck on string s2
                if((s1.charAt(i+j)!=s2.charAt(j)){//(i+j)-----"i" is on one index and "j" is incrementing by 1 so for "i" to go to next character we write (i+j)
                    break;
                }//otherwise loop will continue because pattern is matching
            }
            if(j==N){//we have got the match........you might say j=N-1...but its wrong because last increment of j has terminate the loop so (j==N)
                 b=true;
                 break;//because we dont want to continue further
            }
        
        }
        return b;
